# query-duplicate-question-detection

The project "Query Duplicate Question Detection" focuses on developing a system that can identify duplicate or similar questions within a given dataset. 
The objective is to improve the efficiency of question-answering systems and community forums by reducing redundancy. 

The project involves using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and compare the semantic similarity between pairs of questions. It may include methods like sentence embedding, word embeddings, or neural network architectures such as Siamese or Transformer models. The system aims to accurately identify duplicate or similar questions, enabling users to find relevant answers more efficiently and avoiding repetitive content. Ultimately, the project aims to enhance user experience and increase the effectiveness of information retrieval systems.
